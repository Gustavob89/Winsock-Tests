Wikipedia is a free multilingual open-source wiki-based online encyclopedia edited and maintained by a community of volunteer editors, started on 15 January 2001 as an English-language encyclopedia. Soon, non-English editions were created: the German and Catalan editions were created on circa 16 March,[1] the French edition was created on 23 March,[2] and the Swedish edition was created on 23 May.[3] As of May 2021, Wikipedia articles have been created in 321 editions, with 310 currently active and 11 closed.[4]

The Meta-Wiki language committee, consisting of 16 members, is in charge of managing the policies on creating a new Wikimedia project edition, processing requests, as well as "supporting and coordinating new projects to optimize their success." In order to pass eligibility, a language must have a valid ISO 639 code, be "sufficiently unique," and have a "sufficient number of fluent users to form a viable contributor community and an audience for the content." In order to pass eligibility for closure, an edition should either "don't have content or existing content", or possibly "controversial, questionable or in another way uncommon.
